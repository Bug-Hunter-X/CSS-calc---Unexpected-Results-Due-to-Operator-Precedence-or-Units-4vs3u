The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results occur due to operator precedence or unit mismatches. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 20px + 10%);` might not produce the intended result because of the order of operations.  Another common error involves forgetting to add space between the operators and values.
