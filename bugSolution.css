To resolve these issues, ensure that units are consistently used (e.g., all pixels, percentages, or ems), add parenthesis to control operator precedence explicitly, and always put spaces between operators and values.  For example, the correct version of `width: calc(50% - 20px + 10%);` could be written as `width: calc((50% - 20px) + 10%);` or perhaps `width: calc(50% + 10% - 20px);`, depending on the desired outcome. Always check your browser's developer tools to see the calculated values.
